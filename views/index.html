    <p>In 1986 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National
        Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc sponsored Berkeley POSTGRES Project which was led by Michael
        Stonebraker.</p>
    <p>In 1994, an SQL language interpreter was added to POSTGRES. And then, it was released to the web under the name
        of Postgres95. By 1996, the new name PostgreSQL was chosen for the project.</p>
    <p>PostgreSQL supports four standard procedural languages (which allows the users to write their own code which can
        be executed by database server) - PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl and PL/Python.</p>
    <p>PostgreSQL supports B+-tree, hash, generalized search trees (GiST) and generalized inverted indexes (GIN). Users
        can also create their own customized indexes.</p>
